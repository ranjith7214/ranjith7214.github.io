- **[Learning Task-Driven Control Policies via Information Bottlenecks, RSS 2016](https://roboticsproceedings.org/rss16/p101.pdf)**: An elegant application of information theory principles to enhance robustness in deep learning.

- **[Generalization in Reinforcement Learning by Soft Data Augmentation by Nicklas Hansen and Xiaolong Wang](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13389)**: Explores how significant vision perturbations can improve the robustness of perception policies.

- **[HYPERNETWORKS by David Ha, Andrew Dai, and Quoc V. Le from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09106)**: Examines how soft weight sharing in a multitask setup can help extract abstract concepts when sufficient tasks and data points are available. Investigates whether a larger neural network is better than a small hypernetwork for multitasking and whether the plasticity of a hypernetwork can address few-shot learning challenges.
