## Elegant Papers


- **[Drone Application for the Indian Power Sector](https://sarepenergy.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230217_Revised-Cover-Drone-Applications-for-Power-Sector_Whitepaper_FINAL-Print.pdf)**: Drones are transforming the Indian power sector by enhancing efficiency and safety. Key applications include transmission line inspection, vegetation management using LiDAR, and project monitoring. They provide real-time data and minimize manual intervention, especially in challenging terrains. The Drone Rules, 2021, have also streamlined their integration into power operations.

- **[PROGRAMMING OF AN INDOOR AUTONOMOUS DRONE AND METROLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/retrieve/ec03f4cc-0fe9-4b5a-9bbc-da8087b7c1de/2020_10_2_Bagher_Oskooei_Fereshte_10606740.pdf)**: An elegant application of information theory principles to enhance robustness in deep learning.

<!-- - **[Generalization in Reinforcement Learning by Soft Data Augmentation by Nicklas Hansen and Xiaolong Wang](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13389)**: Explores how significant vision perturbations can improve the robustness of perception policies.

- **[HYPERNETWORKS by David Ha, Andrew Dai, and Quoc V. Le from Google Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09106)**: Examines how soft weight sharing in a multitask setup can help extract abstract concepts when sufficient tasks and data points are available. Investigates whether a larger neural network is better than a small hypernetwork for multitasking and whether the plasticity of a hypernetwork can address few-shot learning challenges. -->
