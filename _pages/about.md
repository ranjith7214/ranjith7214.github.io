## Mission Statement
My mission is to advance the field of swarm robotics and nature-inspired efficient robotic systems. Through biomimicry and studying natural systems like bee swarms, I aim to develop innovative robotics solutions for real-world challenges in mapping, exploration, construction, medicine, and more.

I envision a future where robot swarms adeptly coordinate and collaborate just as organism swarms do, leading to transformative applications. My goal is to contribute cutting-edge research pushing us toward this future. I aim to build on existing work in simultaneous localization and mapping, path planning, object detection, and language understanding to create robust swarm systems.

By sharing my passion for this research through my writing, I hope to excite and inspire others about the promise of swarm robotics. I welcome collaboration with like-minded researchers as well as feedback from readers. Together we can invent the next generation of efficient, capable robotic systems that take cues from the natural world.

## News

- [2021-08-01] I am excited to announce that I have joined the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) at IIIT Hyderabad as a Research Associate. I will be working with [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) on Swarm SLAM and Diffusion based path planning.
