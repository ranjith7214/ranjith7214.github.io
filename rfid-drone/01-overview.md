# RFID Drone Project

## Introduction
The RFID Drone Project aims to revolutionize the use of drones in inventory management and asset tracking. This project addresses the challenges of efficiently scanning large areas while dealing with data noise, outliers, and communication bandwidth limitations.

## Challenges and Context
In the realm of RFID technology, accurately capturing and processing RFID signals poses persistent challenges. One significant factor affecting performance is the size of the RFID antennas, which directly influences the range and effectiveness of signal transmission. Larger antennas typically provide better range and sensitivity, but may also add weight and complexity to drone designs.

Additionally, traditional methods often struggle with noisy signal data and require substantial communication bandwidth. These challenges necessitate robust solutions that optimize both antenna performance and the communication process to ensure reliable asset tracking.
